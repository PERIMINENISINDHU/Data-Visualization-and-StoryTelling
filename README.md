This Power BI report provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attendance data across various batches in the "AI - Data Quality Analyst" program. The dashboard includes key visualizations such as bar charts comparing total days present per employee, batch-wise average attendance percentages, and pie charts showing the distribution of attendance status (Present, Absent, No Class). Line charts and scatter plots are used to analyze trends and relationships between attendance days and total hours spent. Heatmaps help compare batch-level productivity, while KPI cards highlight important metrics like overall average attendance, total working days, and the number of employees below the 50% attendance threshold. Interactive filters allow users to slice the data by batch, employee, or attendance range for deeper insights. This analysis helps identify attendance patterns, low-performing batches, and outliers, enabling better decision-making and follow-ups.
